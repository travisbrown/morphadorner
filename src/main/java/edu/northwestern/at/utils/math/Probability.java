/** Probability: stores and operates on log probabilties.
 *
 *	<p>
 *	When working with large numbers of small probabilities,
 *	it is helpful to work in "log space", e.g., the natural log
 *	of the probabilities, to avoid problems with overflow and
 *	underflow.  This class provides for storing a probability in
 *	log form, and adding, substracting, multiplying, and dividing
 *	the log probabilities to minimize accuracy loss.
 *	</p>
 *
 *	<p>
 *	Probabilities must be floating point values from zero through one
 *	inclusive, e.g., [0 , 1].
 *	</p>
 *
 *	<p>
 *	A probability of zero is stored as -infinity, which
 *	correctly propagates through arithmetic operations.  The
 *	value of exp(-infinity) is 0.0 as it should be.
 *	</p>
